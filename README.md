# NBA Shot Charts

A python script made to create shot charts for any NBA player season or career (from 1996 to present).

For a tutorial on how to use this code, click ([here (coming soon)](http://google.com)).
To see what everything going on in the charts mean, click ([here (coming soon)](http://google.com)).

A directory of charts Iâ€™ve created (updated weekly) can be found by clicking ([here (coming soon)](http://google.com)).
