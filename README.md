d# NBA Shot Charts

A python script made to create shot charts for any NBA player season or career (from 1996 to present).

These charts are primarily an extension from the work of [Dan Vatterott](http://www.danvatterott.com/) and [Savvas Tjortjoglou](savvastjortjoglou.com). My charts are an attempt at combining my favorite parts of a number of other shot charts on the internet (primarily from: [Kirk Goldsberry](https://www.instagram.com/kirkgoldsberry/), [Buckets](http://buckets.peterbeshai.com/app/#/playerView/201935_2015), [BallR](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/ballr-interactive-nba-shot-charts-with-r-and-shiny/), and [Swish](http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/)) into one chart.

For a tutorial on how to use this code, click [here (coming soon)](http://google.com).

A directory of charts Iâ€™ve created (updated weekly) can be found [on Dropbox](http://bit.ly/CR_nba_shot_charts).
